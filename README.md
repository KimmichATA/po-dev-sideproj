# A place for Product people and engineers to meet for side projects

## Value proposition [TBD]

In the last few projects I came to really appreciate what big difference a really good product owner (think https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/roles/product-owner ) can make. That is in writing and properly prioritizing a product backlog.

On the other hand, since I started developing software I came about many coders who wish to build something in their (unpaid) free time but can't really come up with a vision of what to build or how to prioritize.

I imagine, there must also be some professional product owners out there, who wish to build something in their free time but don't have coders to pair up with.

Wouldn't it be awesome if these two groups of people had a place to meet online, jam a few ideas around and pair up to build something nice together?
